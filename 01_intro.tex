\chapter{Introduction and Literature Review}

\begin{quote}
Chapter abstract goes here.
I should check if the concept of "Introduction \emph{and} Lit Review" is required.
Having an abstract for the introduction seems dumb, and I'm not sure I want a monolithic lit review up front.

\section{Introduction}

We're talking about Choreographic Programming (CP).

\subsection{An illustrative example}

\Cref{fig:kvsenclave} shows an example choreography.
Probably a KVS variation.
Here we describe what it does and how to read it.

  A key-value store with a backup server, written in \MultiChor.
           The backup server sends an acknowledgement message \textsf{ack} to the primary server
           if and only if \inlinecode{request} is a \inlinecode{Put}.
           The \inlinecode{broadcast} operator (line 19) ensures KoC
           so that the primary and backup servers are guaranteed to use the same case of \inlinecode{handleBackup},
           but it results in redundant communication (shown in red in the sequence diagram).

  In this variation, the \inlinecode{enclave} operator eliminates the redundant communication.
           The enclaved sub-choreography is indicated by a box in the sequence diagram.
           On line~2, \inlinecode{@@ nobody} is \MultiChor idiom explained in \Cref{sec:membership}.

    %%\Description{In the top section, twenty four lines of Haskell code using the MultiChor library, with a UML sequence diagram of that program.
%%	The code defines a choreography called "kvs", and helper-functions "handleRequest" and "handleBackup".
%%	In the sequence diagram, first "client" sends "request" to "server",
%%	  then "server" sends "request-prime" to "client" and "backup",
%%	  then backup calls "handleRequest",
%%	  then backup may send "ack" to "server",
%%	  then server calls "handleRequest",
%%	  then server sends "response" to "client.
%%	The bottom sections shows changes to the code in the top section.
%%	In particular, the return type of "handleBackup" is changed to exclude "client".
%%	In the updated sequence diagram, the part of the protocol representing "handleBackup" is in a box named "enclave",
%%	  and the spurious transmission of "request-prime" from "server" to "client" is omitted.

\subsection{Layout and Contributions}

The remainder of this chapter covers the history and theory of CP
and discusses some modern work relevant to the ongoing development of CP systems.
In particular, \Cref{sec:knowledge-of-choice} discusses the "Knowledge of Choice" problem,
a central difficulty in the design of CP systems,
and a number of strategies that have been used to solve it.

\Cref{sec:formalism} presents our first contribution:
a formal model of a CP system with two novel features:
\emph{multiply-located values} (MLVs)
and \emph{enclaves}.
These features combine to allow a compelling new strategy for KoC management.

\Cref{sec:multichor} presents our implementation of the enclaves-\&-MLVs paradigm in Haskell.



\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
In this section, we give a brief overview of choreographic programming (CP).
For a comprehensive introduction to the topic, we refer the reader to~\cite{montesi_book}.

Choreographic programming is a paradigm that expresses a distributed system
as a single, global program describing the behavior and interactions of all parties.
The global view of the distributed system enables easier reasoning about the system's behavior;
for example choreographic languages can ensure \emph{deadlock freedom}~\cite{montesi-carbone-dfbd}
and choreographies can be composed modularly like normal single-threaded protocols.



\subsection{Knowledge of Choice}
\label{sec:knowledge-of-choice}

Choreographies with conditionals
(\inlinecode{if}-expressions or anything that could be used for conditional control-flow)
introduce
a challenge for endpoint projection:
\emph{some parties might not know which branch to take!}
This challenge is referred to as the \emph{knowledge of choice}  (KoC)~\cite{castagna-knowledge-of-choice} problem.
All choreographic programming languages include a strategy for KoC
that ensures that relevant parties have enough information to play their part in the program.
