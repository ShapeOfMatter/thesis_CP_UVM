\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Choreographic programming (CP)
is a language paradigm for implementing distributed systems in which the programmer writes one unified program, called a choreography,
that describes how the participants of the system interact
from a third-person-omniscient perspective.~\shortcite{montesi-carbone-dfbd,montesi-dissertation,montesi_book}
A choreography can be translated into to a collection of executable programs for use in the real world, one for each participant;
this process is called endpoint projection (EPP).
The CP approach has benefits both for understandability of distributed system implementations,
and for strong static guarantees about the deadlock-freedom of the resulting executable code~\cite{montesi-carbone-dfbd}.

The study of CP is comparatively young; while some of the ideas have existed informally as far back as the 1970s,
choreographic programming as it's understood today was first formalized in~\shortcite{montesi-carbone-dfbd}.
In this chapter we describe the central concepts of choreographic programming,
its advantages and disadvantages,
and past and ongoing work to push the boundaries of the kinds of systems it can implement.

\subsection{Layout}

\Cref{sec:formalism} presents
a formal model of a CP system with
\emph{multiply-located values} (MLVs)
and \emph{conclaves}.
These features combine to allow a compelling new strategy for KoC management.
In particular, all well-typed \HLSCentral choreographies are projectable and have cromulent KoC by construction.
In \Cref{sec:formalism-comparisons} we compare \HLSCentral to representative systems that use other KoC management strategies.

\Cref{sec:multichor} presents our implementation of the conclaves-\&-MLVs paradigm in Haskell.
The \MultiChor library is already available on Hackage, Haskell's main package management system.
\MultiChor directly implements the main concepts of \HLSCentral as a monadic eDSL in Haskell,
and combines Haskell's Hindley–Milner-based type system with a proof-witness system
to capture the requisite notion of a well-typed choreography.
We also describes \emph{census polymorphism},
a design pattern for choreographies that different CP systems may or may not support.
\MultiChor is the first CP implementation to support type-safe census polymorphism,
by which we mean the ability to write choreographies
that are parametric over their set of participants.
Because \MultiChor is fully embedded in and interoperable with Haskell,
functional-programming patterns can be applied to the choreographic setting without further theoretical or infrastructural work.
\MultiChor's census polymorphic functions work by applying advanced type-level programming techniques native to modern Haskell
to \MultiChor's core API.
We discuss census polymorphism in greater detail in \Cref{sec:census-poly}.

\Cref{sec:future} explores possibilities for the future development of \MultiChor,
in particular we show that located values are not a necessary primitive component of CP systems.
We show this
by developing \minichor,
a variant of \MultiChor which can implement the same choreographies using only conclaves, communication, and local computation on normal ("naked") values.

\Cref{sec:conclusion} concludes this dissertation and describes promising avenues for future research.

\subsection{Contributions}
We enumerate four substantive contributions of this work:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Description of the conclaves-\&-MLVs choreographic programming paradigm and knowledge-of-choice management strategy.
		In \Cref{sec:formalism} we formalize these ideas,
		prove relevant theorems about the formalism,
		and compare the system to other CP systems.
	\item Implementation of conclaves-\&-MLVs paradigm as a Haskell eDSL named \MultiChor.
		In \Cref{sec:multichor} we discuss the engineering challenges involved,
		our solutions to them,
		some example programs,
		and the qualitative experience of writing software in \MultiChor.
	\item Description of and implementation of census polymorphism in \MultiChor.
		Although it is common to describe concurrent protocols parametrically with respect to the quantities of participants,
		we know of only one prior system capable of actually expressing choreographies in that way:
		an un-implemented extension to Procedural Choreographies described abstractly in \cite{cp_practice_cruz_filipe_montesi}.
		We discus this subject and our implementation in \Cref{sec:census-poly}.
	\item Demonstration by example that (multiply or singly) located values need not be a primitive concept in choreographic programming.
		Specifically, \Cref{sec:future} describes a transformation of \MultiChor into \minichor,
		an equally expressive CP system in which MLVs are an emergent special case of conclaved computation.
		In other words, in an appropriate computational context and type system, the conclaves-\&-MLVs system
		can be collapsed into a \emph{just conclaves} system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Basics of Choreographic Programming}
Characteristic features of CP are the use of a single program to represent the behavior of multiple concurrent parties or threads,
and a unified communication operator typically written $\rightsquigarrow$, \inlinecode{~>}, \inlinecode{comm}, or \inlinecode{com}.
For example, the expression \inlinecode{Alice{"hello"} ~> Bob}
represents both Alice's implementation \inlinecode{send "hello" to Bob}
and Bob's implementation \inlinecode{receive String from Alice}.
Endpoint projection is the process of automatically deriving these "local" implementations from a choreography; see \Cref{sec:endpoint-projection}.
Traditional computations (possibly annotated with a location)
and choreographic expressions like \inlinecode{comm} can be sequenced and composed to make more involved choreographies.
For example, we could write a simple call-and-response choreography like
\begin{align*}
  & x := \textsf{Client}\{\texttt{"Hello, my name is "} +\!\!+\; \textit{input}()\} \rightsquigarrow \textsf{Server} ; \\[-0.9em]
  & \textsf{Server}\{\textit{log}(x)\} ; \\[-0.9em]
  & \_ := \textsf{Server}\{\texttt{"Hi "} +\!\!+\; \textit{last}(\textit{words}(x))\} \rightsquigarrow \textsf{Client} ;
\end{align*}
to represent both a client's behavior,
\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{send}\; \texttt{"Hello, my name is "} +\!\!+\; \textit{input}() \;\textsf{to}\; \textsf{Server} ; \\[-0.9em]
  & \_ := \textsf{receive String from Server} ;
\end{align*}
and the corresponding server's behavior:
\begin{align*}
  & x := \textsf{receive String from Client} ; \\[-0.9em]
  & \textit{log}(x) ; \\[-0.9em]
  & \textsf{send}\; \texttt{"Hi "} +\!\!+\; \textit{last}(\textit{words}(x)) \;\textsf{to}\; \textsf{Client} ;
\end{align*}
Compare the above pseudo-code with the \MultiChor code in \Cref{fig:call-n-response}.

  \begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
	  The choreography \inlinecode{callNResponse} is defined on lines~2--8;
	  its type is declared on line~1.
	  In \MultiChor local computations must be sequenced with, rather than freely composed with,
	  communication operations,
	  \eg on line~3 \inlinecode{name} is first computed (by the side-effect-full \inlinecode{getInput})
	  before it can be sent as a message on line~4.
	  \MultiChor does contain helper functions that would allow a user to express \inlinecode{callNResponse}
	  in a natural three-line format, but we neglect to use them here in the interest of simplicity.
	  Endpoint projection of \inlinecode{callNResponse} to \inlinecode{"Client"}
	  would result in a first-person procedure like \inlinecode{clientBehavior} (line~13),
	  and \inlinecode{"Server"} would similarly get \inlinecode{serverBehavior} (line~20).
	  Those two definitions are somewhat simplified compared to the actual \inlinecode{Network} values
	  \MultiChor manipulates at runtime;
	  the structure of the modules makes \inlinecode{unwrap} (lines~22 and~23) inaccessible to users,
	  and in practice no human should ever need to inspect a \inlinecode{Network} value generated by \inlinecode{epp}.

\subsection{A More Involved Example}
To motivate choreographic programming,
consider the three (non-choreographic, single-thread) programs in \Cref{fig:kvspiecewise},
which are intended to run concurrently and pass messages back and forth between each other.
The overall effect is a protocol in which the client makes a \inlinecode{Get} or \inlinecode{Put} request to
a server (with a backup) that manages a key-value-store (KVS).
Even this simplified example takes a moment for a reader to make sense of;
one must read the three programs, infer the correspondence between messages sent and received by the three parties,
and judge for oneself if the communication protocol implemented is sensical.
One might even judge that this simple protocol has a bug:
if the request is a \inlinecode{Get}, the backup server will hang indefinitely!

  \end{mdframed}
\end{figure}

In \Cref{sec:history} we will mention some other techniques that have been used to facilitate
writing large and complicated concurrent protocols,
but here we jump directly to choreographic programming (CP).
\Cref{fig:kvspseudo} shows the same protocol as \Cref{fig:kvspiecewise}, but implemented as a choreography.
In this form there is no cognitive overhead for matching \inlinecode{send} and \inlinecode{recv} operations,
because matching pairs of them are combined into monolithic \inlinecode{comm} operations.
The entire protocol can be read at once in a sensical order.
(The order in which operations are presented in a choreography is not necessarily the order in which they will happen;
the participants are not guaranteed to all start at the same physical time, or to operate at the same speeds.)
Re-writing the example KVS system as a choreography does not immediately solve the issue
of what the backup server should do in the event of a \inlinecode{Get} request,
but it makes the problem detectable by static analysis.
In fact, the choreography in \Cref{fig:kvspseudo} cannot compile in any real CP system
because \inlinecode{"backup"}'s behavior is ambiguous!
\Cref{fig:kvsconclave} shows two variations of how to realize the KVS behavior in Haskell using our \MultiChor library.

	  Real CP systems have ways of detecting and fixing problems like this.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Choreographic programming is a paradigm that expresses a distributed system
as a single, global program describing the behavior and interactions of all parties.
The global view of the distributed system enables easier reasoning about the system's behavior;
for example choreographic languages can ensure \emph{deadlock freedom}~\cite{montesi-carbone-dfbd}
and choreographies can be composed modularly like normal single-threaded protocols.

\subsection{History and Adjacent Domains}
\label{sec:history}

Theoretical and pragmatic frameworks for thinking clearly about concurrent and communicating systems are many and varied,
and include well known examples like Petri Nets that are over sixty years old~\cite{Petri1962}.
A number of other systems from the following decades are important both as historical markers and because modern research
builds directly on their ideas, their theory, structural patterns, and terminology.
The actor model~\cite{hewitt_actor_model} posits the description of an "actor" and their behavior as the fundamental
unit of a concurrent program, while being deliberately abstract about what an actor actually is.
Process- or \textpi-calculi are generally characterized by a designated syntax for parallelism
(actions that may happen in any order or simultaneously),
and typically have names or addresses associated with the participating processes and/or channels of communication between processes.
\cite{baeten2004} gives a good history of the field as it developed and diversified through the end of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century.

A basic goal in computer science is to provide guarantees that a program \emph{can't} exbibit a behavior that has been deemed bad,
\eg run-time exceptions or deadlocking;
a common way to accomplish this is by applying a type checker to the program.
One successful system (or style of system) for typing concurrent protocols has been \emph{multiparty session types} (MPST)~\cite{honda-mpsts}.
MPST encode a protocol of (possible sequences of) communication in a \emph{global type} in the language of MPST.
Projection of a global type to a named party ("endpoint") in the type yields a \emph{local type}
that can be ascribed to (and enforced against) an implementation (\eg in a \textpi-calculus) of that process's behavior\footnote{
	As in CP, the endpoint projection function in MPST is incomplete.
}.
In addition to the simple "what kind of thing might \inlinecode{x} be" sense of type safety,
MPST also provided communication safety (\eg a party never binds a received message to the wrong variable at runtime)
and a form of deadlock freedom.

Research extending MPST's expressiveness (the space of desirable programs that can be judged well-formed)
and safety (the space of undesired programs that can be statically rejected) is ongoing.
For example \cite{stutz2025} describe Automata-based Multiparty Protocols,
a MPST-like framework that, with various caveats, is more expressive than MPST and in which endpoint projection is total.
\cite{leBrun2025}, presented at the same conference, directly extend the syntax and semantics of MPST
with first-class process names and open-ended receiving channels;
in addition to the utility of these features \textit{per se}, this lets their system model mutual-exclusion and race conditions.
One way to think about choreographic programming is as the extension of the core ideas of MPST to include
\emph{both} the communication plan and the implementation of the computations each party is doing.

Although in this present work we use the noun "choreography" to refer to actual programs written in CP systems,
the word was already in use before the invention of choreographic programming \textit{per se}.
The broader sense of the word is any unified 3rd-person description of or plan for interaction between two or more participating systems.
Pseudo-code diagrams featuring a unified communication operator "→"
were being used to describe cryptographic protocols at least as early as 1978 \cite{needham_schroeder_1978}.
As an example,
\cite{w3c2005} presented the \emph{"Web Services Choreography Description Language"}
in which a user could specify the interaction, the sequence of communications, between parties.
Like MPST (introduced a few years later),
this was a specification language; implementations compatible with a given specification needed to be written separately.

Another technique for multiparty programming
(broadly, any technique for representing the behavior of a system of concurrent participants in as a single program)
is \emph{multitier programming}.
A multitier program has a "first person" perspective that privileges one party or role;
this perspective shifts to other roles, with implicit or explicit communication mediating these shifts.
ScalaLoci is an example of a multitier language with an embedded implementation in Scala and a formalism demonstrating its soundness~\cite{scalaLoci}.
A similar computational model named "first person choreographies", implemented as a Rascal proof-of-concept named 1CPLT,
omits ScalaLoci's reactive programming aspects~\cite{jongmans1cp2025}.
Of particular interest to our current work, both these languages can represent applications with variable quantities of participants.
The network behavior of a system built in these languages is less straightforward than that of a similar-looking choreography in two ways:
critical contextual information (roughly corresponding to Knowledge of Choice) is communicated implicitly,
and the exact communications that must or could happen (which depend on the variable quantities of participants) are determined dynamically.
Nonetheless, \cite{multiparty-languages} were able to show a degree of equivalence between minimalist models of multitier and choreographic programming.

\subsection{Endpoint Projection}
\label{sec:endpoint-projection}
CP systems necessarily include a means by which a given computer can execute the behavior of a role in the choreography.
Typically, this takes the form of a function from choreographies to programs in a "local" language
which the target computer can execute.
Such a function is parameterized by the target role, and is called \emph{Endpoint Projection} (EPP);
the roles are "endpoints", \ie surfaces from which and into which messages pass,
and the choreography is "projected" in the sense that the given endpoint's view of it is extracted.

As an example, EPP of the choreography in \Cref{fig:kvsconclave}\emph{(b)} to each of the three participants
would yield respective programs very similar to the ones in \Cref{fig:kvspiecewise},
except that the primary server would always send the request to the backup server
(and therefor the backup server would know how to proceed).

In a choreographic program, many (in some systems, all) values will be \emph{located}:
they will have explicit or implicit metadata indicating their owner.
EPP of a located value to its owner results in the value itself
(typically with the ownership annotation removed),
and EPP to anyone else results in a special placeholder symbol, \eg $\bot$.
The appearance of $\bot$ in a party's projection is not an error,
but attempting to do any semantic evaluation on $\bot$ would be,
so an important correctness property for choreographies is that parties never do that.

\subsection{Knowledge of Choice}
\label{sec:knowledge-of-choice}

Choreographies with conditionals
(\inlinecode{if}-expressions or anything that could be used for conditional control-flow)
introduce
a challenge for endpoint projection:
\emph{some parties might not know which branch to take!}
This challenge is referred to as the \emph{knowledge of choice}  (KoC)~\cite{castagna-knowledge-of-choice} problem.
All choreographic programming languages include a strategy for KoC
that ensures that relevant parties have enough information to play their part in the program.

The pseudo-code in \Cref{fig:kvspseudo} shows a simple instance of this exact problem:
\inlinecode{backup} doesn't know whether to expect a message or not,
because that decision depends on a value (\inlinecode{request'}) that \inlinecode{backup} doesn't have.
\Cref{fig:kvsconclave}\emph{(a)} implements the KoC strategy used by HasChor~\cite{shen-haschor}: the branch guard is broadcast to everyone.
HasChor's authors knew this to be an inefficient (but expedient) solution.
As we show in \Cref{fig:kvsconclave}\emph{(b)}, \MultiChor can do better.

A more traditional approach,
which we refer to as \emph{select-\&-merge},
is to include in one's language a special operator just for communicating KoC.
This operator is called "\inlinecode[bash]{select}"; it sends a statically-declared flag
to the recipient to select which of that party's possible behaviors should be activated.
For example, \Cref{fig:kvs_snm} shows how our KVS choreography might be expressed in a select-\&-merge system.
Under both the centralized semantics and type analysis, \inlinecode[bash]{select} is a no-op!
During EPP, \inlinecode[bash]{select} results in "offer" and "choose" actions at the receiver and sender, respectively.
Because \inlinecode[bash]{select} doesn't affect typing,
in \Cref{fig:kvs_snm} it would not be possible to encode the need for the lines~9 and~12 in Haskell's type system.
Instead, such CP systems enforce KoC requirements in their "merge" operator, which is applied during EPP.
Any party besides the owner of a branch guard will replace the entire conditional expression with the merge of their projections of the branches.
The merge of two "offer" expressions is an offer of the union of the possible continuations;
merges of any other combinations of expressions are only defined when the two expressions are the same.
Thus, if lines~9 and~12 were omitted from \Cref{fig:kvs_snm}, the error would be detected during EPP to \inlinecode{backup}
when the system tried to merge \inlinecode{{}} with
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=30pt,fontsize=\small]{haskell}
{ request'' <- recv primary;
  success <- handleRequest request'' backupStateRef;
  send success primary  }
\end{minted}
A substantial body of research has explored the soundness select-\&-merge
and its fundamentals, implementation, and extensions
\cite{montesi-carbone-dfbd,core_choreographies,giallorenzo-choral,robust_choreographies}.
That said, HasChor, \MultiChor, ChoRus, and ChoreoTS all do EPP at runtime\cite{batesenclaves},
so using EPP to detect KoC problems would not be a satisfactory solution for them.

	  would result in a system that could not detect KoC errors until runtime.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A Select-\&-Merge Choreography: a key-value store with a backup server}
  \label{fig:kvs_snm}
  \end{mdframed}
\end{figure}

Yet another KoC strategy was proposed by \cite{jongmans2022predicates}.
Their approach requires writing distinct guards for every
participant in a conditional expression; they show how to use predicate transformers to check that
such distributed decisions are unanimous.
This system is verbose, but at least as expressive as the one we describe in this work.

\subsection{The "Census" typing context}
\label{sec:census}
Although it is a hallmark of CP that a user may write actions for various parties in any given place in the program
without demarcations of who "control" is passing to,
it is not necessarily the case that every party that exists is eligible to take action at every place in the choreography.
Some earlier works, \eg \cite{chor-lambda}, have tracked these sets of participants in their type systems,
and used that typing context to control participation inside of function bodies.
Such a typing context plays a more active role in this present work, so we coin the term \emph{"census"}
for a typing context that controls which parties are "present" to participate in any given part of a choreography.
A party not listed in a census typically should not evaluate that section of the choreography;
exactly how that's enforced or implemented will depend on the system in question.

\subsection{Additional Literature}
\label{sec:modern-work}

Research and development of CP systems seems to have accelerated since approximately 2022.
Pirouette~\cite{hirsch2021pirouette}, Chorλ~\cite{chor-lambda},
and  PolyChorλ~\cite{graversen2023polychor}
are (higher order) functional languages for writing select-\&-merge choreographies;
PolChorλ additionally introduces polymorphism over identities of parties.
Choral~\cite{giallorenzo-choral} is a choreographic language implementing the select-\&-merge paradigm
and targeting industrial use;
it runs on the JVM and can easily import local Java code.
Dyno~\cite{zakhour23} is a CP system for Android development;
it's key feature is the ability to resolve the location and ownership of data and computation dynamically,
while still providing static safety guarantees.

Excitingly, CP libraries for a variety of general purpose languages have recently appeared on the scene.
These include UniChorn~\cite{unichorn}, Chorex~\cite{chorex-github}, and Klor~\cite{klor-github}.
All three are under development; here we report on their state toward the end of 2024.
UniChorn is a port of HasChor into the Unison programming language.
To implement EPP, it uses the Unison feature of \emph{abilities}, better known in the literature as algebraic effects~\cite{plotkin-2003,plotkin-2013}.
This implementation approach, which was also recently proposed by~\cite{shen-alg-eff-cp},
can be thought of as a generalization of the free(r)-monad approach.
As a direct port of HasChor, UniChorn does not support conclaves, MLVs, or census polymorphism.
Chorex is a CP system for Elixir, and Klor is a CP system for Clojure;
both Chorex and Klor leverage the powerful macro systems of their respective host languages to carry out EPP.
Chorex uses the select-\&-merge KoC strategy, and unprojectable choreographies can be detected at macro expansion time.
Klor, on the other hand, is effectively an conclaves-\&-MLVs system, but their API differs from the implementations we present here,
and the authors have not yet shown what safety guarantees it does or does not offer.
Neither Chorex nor Klor support census polymorphism.

Wysteria~\cite{wysteria} and Symphony~\cite{Sweet_2023} are domain-specific languages for \emph{secure multiparty computation}.
Programs in these languages can exhibit census polymorphism,
but they have homomorphic encryption baked into their
semantics for communication,
and they are not intended for general-purpose choreographic programming.
Wysteria has a \inlinecode{par} language construct, used for evaluating an expression at a set of locations,
that is somewhat similar in spirit to our conclaves.
However, applying the conclave concept to choreographic programming, and to the choreographic knowledge-of-choice problem in particular,
is to our knowledge a novel contribution of this paper.
Symphony does not support conditionals, and therefore KoC propagation is a moot point for them.

Another possible antecedent to census polymorphism as described in \Cref{sec:census-poly} is \cite{cp_practice_cruz_filipe_montesi},
which extends the syntax of Procedural Choreographies (PC) \cite{cp_procedural_cruz_filipe_montesi}
to support lists of processes as arguments to procedure calls.
Exact comparison between the extended PC system and \MultiChor is difficult for a few reasons:
First, PC is an advanced select-\&-merge system which tracks mutable network topology instead of a census.
Second, in PC's computational model processes serve double-duty as "participants" who do things and as "variables" that store data;
this is a sensible choice for their target usage context: parallelized object-oriented programming in which communication is cheap.
Understanding the limits of their syntax extensions in the context of their computational model is difficult because
the commensurate typing rule extensions not explicit.
Third, PC does not have an implementation.
We do not assert here whether either system's expressivity subsumes that of the other.
