\section{Introduction}

Choreographic programming (CP)
is a language paradigm for implementing distributed systems in which the programmer writes one unified program, called a choreography,
that describes how the participants of the system interact
from a third-person-omniscient perspective.~\shortcite{montesi-carbone-dfbd,montesi-dissertation,montesi_book}
A choreography can be translated into to a collection of executable programs for use in the real world, one for each participant;
this process is called endpoint projection (EPP).
The CP approach has benefits both for understandability of distributed system implementations,
and for strong static guarantees about the deadlock-freedom of the resulting executable code~\cite{montesi-carbone-dfbd}.

The study of CP is comparatively young; while some of the ideas have existed informally as far back as the 1970s,
choreographic programming as it's understood today was first formalized in~\shortcite{montesi-carbone-dfbd}.
In this chapter we describe the central concepts of choreographic programming,
its advantages and disadvantages,
and past and ongoing work to push the boundaries of the kinds of systems it can implement.

\subsection{An illustrative example}

Consider the three programs in \Cref{fig:kvspiecewise},
which are intended to run concurrently and pass messages back and forth between each other.
The overall effect is an elementary process in which the client makes a \inlinecode{Get} or \inlinecode{Put} request to
a server (with a backup) that manages a key-value-store (KVS).
Even this simplified example takes a moment for a reader to make sense of;
one must read the three programs, infer the correspondence between messages sent and received by the three parties,
and judge for oneself if the communication protocol implemented is sensical.
One might even judge that this simple protocol has a bug:
if the request is a \inlinecode{Get}, the backup server will hang indefinitely!

In \Cref{sec:history} we will mention some intermediate frameworks that have historically been used to facilitate
writing large and complicated concurrent protocols,
but here we jump ahead to choreographic programming (CP).
\Cref{fig:kvspseudo} shows the same protocol as \Cref{fig:kvspiecewise}, but implemented as a choreography.
In this form there is no cognitive overhead for matching \inlinecode{send} and \inlinecode{recv} operations,
because matching pairs of them are combined into monolithic \inlinecode{comm} operations.
The entire protocol can be read at once in a sensical order.
(The order in which operations are presented in a choreography is not necessarily the order in which they will happen;
the participants are not guaranteed to all start at the same physical time, or to operate at the same speeds.)
Re-writing the example KVS system as a choreography does not immediately solve the issue
of what the backup server should do in the event of a \inlinecode{Get} request,
but it makes the problem detectable by static analysis.
In fact, the choreography in \Cref{fig:kvspseudo} cannot compile in any real CP system
because \inlinecode{"backup"}'s behavior is ambiguous.
\Cref{fig:kvsenclave} shows two variations of how to realize the KVS behavior in Haskell using our \MultiChor library.

	  This pseudo-code choreography implements the protocol from \Cref{fig:kvspiecewise} as a single program.
	  As written, it is not actually realizable because \inlinecode{backup} doesn't know
	  whether to expect a message or not.
	  Real CP systems have ways of detecting and fixing problems like this.

\subsection{Layout and Contributions}

The remainder of this chapter covers the history and theory of CP
and discusses some modern work relevant to the ongoing development of CP systems.
In particular, \Cref{sec:knowledge-of-choice} discusses the "Knowledge of Choice" problem,
a central difficulty in the design of CP systems,
and a number of strategies that have been used to solve it.

\Cref{sec:formalism} presents our first contribution:
a formal model of a CP system with two novel features:
\emph{multiply-located values} (MLVs)
and \emph{enclaves}.
These features combine to allow a compelling new strategy for KoC management.
In particular, all well-typed \HLSCentral choreographies are projectable and have cromulent KoC by construction.
In \Cref{sec:formalism-comparisons} we compare \HLSCentral to representative systems that use other KoC management strategies.

\Cref{sec:multichor} presents our second contribution: an implementation of the enclaves-\&-MLVs paradigm in Haskell.
The \MultiChor library is already available on Hackage, Haskell's main package management system.
\MultiChor directly implements the main concepts of \HLSCentral as a monadic eDSL in Haskell,
and combines Haskell's Hindleyâ€“Milner-based type system with a proof-witness system
to capture the requisite notion of a well-typed choreography.

Because \MultiChor is fully embedded in and interoperable with Haskell,
functional-programming patterns can be applied to the choreographic setting without further theoretical or infrastructural work.
The most important example of this, which we call "census polymorphism" is the ability to write choreographies
that are parametric over their set of participants.
This capability is novel among CP systems, and the third contribution presented in this work.
We discuss census polymorphism in greater detail in \Cref{sec:census-poly}.

\Cref{sec:future} explains a plan for modifications to the \MultiChor system to simplify its core mechanisms
and facilitate further theoretical work.



\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Choreographic programming is a paradigm that expresses a distributed system
as a single, global program describing the behavior and interactions of all parties.
The global view of the distributed system enables easier reasoning about the system's behavior;
for example choreographic languages can ensure \emph{deadlock freedom}~\cite{montesi-carbone-dfbd}
and choreographies can be composed modularly like normal single-threaded protocols.

\subsection{History}
\label{sec:history}
\todo{write this section.}

\subsection{Endpoint Projection}
\label{sec:endpoint-projection}
CP systems necessarily include a means by which a given computer can execute the behavior of a role in the choreography.
Typically, this takes the form of a function from choreographies to programs in a "local" language
which the target computer can execute.
Such a function is parameterized by the target role, and is called \emph{Endpoint Projection} (EPP);
the roles are "endpoints", \ie surfaces from which and into which messages pass,
and the choreography is "projected" in the sense that the given endpoint's view of it is extracted.

\todo{example}

\subsection{Knowledge of Choice}
\label{sec:knowledge-of-choice}

Choreographies with conditionals
(\inlinecode{if}-expressions or anything that could be used for conditional control-flow)
introduce
a challenge for endpoint projection:
\emph{some parties might not know which branch to take!}
This challenge is referred to as the \emph{knowledge of choice}  (KoC)~\cite{castagna-knowledge-of-choice} problem.
All choreographic programming languages include a strategy for KoC
that ensures that relevant parties have enough information to play their part in the program.

The pseudo-code in \Cref{fig:kvspseudo} shows a simple instance of this exact problem:
\inlinecode{backup} doesn't know whether to expect a message or not,
because that decision depends on a value (\inlinecode{request'}) that \inlinecode{backup} doesn't have.
\todo{show how s\&m systems do it.}
\todo{show how HasChor does it.}
\todo{describe how predicate transformers would do it.}

\subsection{The "Census" typing context}
\label{sec:census}
Although it is a hallmark of CP that a user may write actions for various parties in any given place in the program
without demarcations of who "control" is passing to,
it is not necessarily the case that every party that exists is eligible to take action at every place in the choreography.
Some earlier works, \eg \cite{chor-lambda}, have tracked these sets of participants in their type systems,
and used that typing context to control participation inside of function bodies.
Such a typing context plays a more active role in this present work, so we coin the term \emph{"census"}
for a typing context that controls which parties are "present" to participate in any given part of a choreography.

A party not listed in a census should will typically skip evaluating that section of the choreography.
In terms of EPP, that's done by projecting the entire clause to âŠ¥ or some similar marker.
