\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we demonstrate the practicality of enclaves-\&-MLVs choreographic programming
by presenting our implementation:
the \MultiChor Haskell library.
\MultiChor is a "just a library" CP system in the style of HasChor.
We adopt HasChor's freer-monads and handlers design pattern,
and embed the key aspects of \HLSCentral's type system as type-level constraints with a bespoke proof-witness system.

A key innovation of \HLSCentral is that KoC is enforced entirely
by type-level management of the census.
By representing the census as a type-level variable in Haskell,
\MultiChor enables polymorphism over both the size and membership of the census,
a feature not considered in the construction of \HLSCentral.
All Haskell typing happens statically, and \MultiChor's EPP happens at runtime (like HasChor's).
This means that, like other cases of polymorphism in Haskell, location polymorphism in \MultiChor must be resolved statically.

A few other desiderata motivate our implementation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It should be possible to broadcast, \ie to multicast a value to the entire census,
          and to use values known to the entire census as normal (un-located) values of their type.
    \item It should be possible to know from an appropriately-written choreography's type that some
          certain party or parties are not involved, are not in its census.
          Users should be able to embed such "enclave" choreographies inside choreographies with larger,
          possibly polymorphic, censuses.
    \item The type system should be able to reason about parties'
          membership in a census or ownership-set
          with normal subset reasoning.
\end{enumerate}
The choreography in Figure~\ref{fig:card-game} showcases the above points.
The census of the whole program appears in the type
and does not specify who the players are.
The \inlinecode{enclaveTo} on line~18
embeds a choreography whose census is exactly the monomorphic \inlinecode{"dealer"}
and a polymorphic \inlinecode{player} (\#2).
The helper-function \inlinecode{broadcast} on line 19 functions as described in \#1.
Many examples of \#3 are automated or hidden in \MultiChor,
but on line~19 the function \inlinecode{inSuper} is applied to
\inlinecode{players :: Subset players ("dealer" : players)}
and \inlinecode{player :: Member player players}
to attest that \inlinecode{player} is present in the census.

\subsection{Censuses, Enclaves, and MLVs in Haskell}
\label{sec:implementation}

\MultiChor uses the same free-monad approach as \HasChor~\cite{shen-haschor} to implement choreographic programming, EPP,
and the final interpretation to a real communication mechanism.
Also like \HasChor, \MultiChor's \inlinecode{Choreo} monad is parameterised by a \emph{local monad} in which parties' local computations can be expressed.
A \MultiChor type \inlinecode{Located ps t} is a multiply-located \inlinecode{t} owned by the parties \inlinecode{ps}.
It is possible to write \MultiChor functions that look and work like each of \HasChor's three primitive operators,
but the derived API in which users write \MultiChor choreographies contains a clear analog of only one of \HasChor's primitives.
Haskell's monadic-\inlinecode{do} notation and purity-oriented type system make \MultiChor code concise and safe
(in the sense that users are unlikely to accidentally invalidate important invariants).

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:formalism},
our KoC strategy requires that the correctness (well-typed-ness) of choreographies be judged in the context of a census.
\MultiChor adds the census as a type parameter of the \inlinecode{Choreo} monad.
Its kind is \inlinecode{[Symbol]},
which is to say that the census is a type-level list of parties and parties are type-level strings.
\inlinecode{Choreo} is \emph{not} an \emph{indexed} monad (that is, executing a monadic operation doesn't change the census),
but monadic operations can take choreographies with smaller censuses as arguments.

The fundamental operations of \MultiChor's \inlinecode{Choreo} monad are
\inlinecode{enclave}, \inlinecode{broadcast'}, \inlinecode{locally'}, and \inlinecode{congruently'}.
Their type signatures are given in \Cref{fig:operators-multichor}.
Like in \HasChor, these are free-monad constructors; their behavior is implemented in interpreters
that carry out EPP or implement a centralized semantics.
Three of them have their names "primed" because the un-primed versions of these names are reserved for more ergonomic derived functions.
For example, \inlinecode{locally'} takes a single argument, a computation in the local monad, and requires that the census contains
\emph{a single party}, who will execute that computation.
The un-primed \inlinecode{locally} takes an additional argument that identifies a single party from a larger census;
it uses \inlinecode{enclave} to correctly call \inlinecode{locally'}.
\inlinecode{broadcast} shares a \inlinecode{Located} value with the entire census so the unwrapped value can be used;
by combining this with \inlinecode{enclave} we can implement point-to-point or multicast communication.
From the perspective of a centralized semantics, \inlinecode{enclave} doesn't do anything at all besides run
the sub-choreography,
but EPP to a party \emph{not} in the sub-census skips the sub-choreography and just returns \inlinecode{Empty}.

\inlinecode{congruently} lets us leverage MLVs to concisely write actively-replicated computations.
In contrast to \inlinecode{locally}, the computation is performed by multiple parties
and the result is multiply-located across all of them.\footnote{
    The entire census participates in the primed version, and its result is returned naked.
    The behavior of \inlinecode{enclave} and the more fundamental rules of monadic programming
    ensure the un-primed \inlinecode{congruently} behaves correctly.
}
For the execution of these actively-replicated computations to correctly return an MLV,
all the parties must be guaranteed to be doing a pure computation on the same data.
Haskell makes it easy to enforce such a guarantee to a practical (but not unbreakable) extent.
This is why \inlinecode{congruently} does not grant access to the local monad \inlinecode{m}.
It also requires that the computation not have access to the specific identity of the computing party,
unlike \inlinecode{locally} and the similar-looking function \inlinecode{parallel} mentioned in \Cref{sec:census-poly}.
Weakening (or subverting) these restrictions would allow a user to violate \MultiChor's invariant that MLVs (\inlinecode{Located} values)
have the same value across all their owners.

It is critical to the safety of \MultiChor that the projection of a choreography to any given party will not use
any other party's \inlinecode{Located} values.
We use the same basic strategy for this as \HasChor:
\inlinecode{Located}'s constructors, \inlinecode{Wrap} and \inlinecode{Empty}, are hidden inside the core module
and afforded only by dependency injection to \inlinecode{locally} and \inlinecode{congruently}.
The specific "unwrapper" functions afforded to \inlinecode{locally} and \inlinecode{congruently}
are known to user code only by their type signatures, which have respective aliases \inlinecode{Unwrap} and \inlinecode{Unwraps}.
\inlinecode{Located}'s constructors are also used by two less-critical functions, \inlinecode{flatten} and \inlinecode{othersForget}.
These are needed for shrinking ownership sets or un-nesting \inlinecode{Located} values;
they could be written using \inlinecode{congruently},
but by implementing them in the core module where they can pattern-match \inlinecode{Located} values we are able to make them not-monadic,
and so more convenient.

\subsection{Membership Constraints}
\label{sec:membership}

It is not trivial for Haskell's type-checker (a component of GHC, the compiler) to judge if
a particular participant owns a multiply-located value or is present in a particular census
when the party or the set are polymorphic.
Declaring membership and subset relations as class constraints can work in some situations,
but this strategy has serious limitations which we find unacceptable.
For example, a rule as obvious as
$(p \in ps_1 \land ps1 \subseteq ps_2) \to p \in ps_2$,
represented in Haskell as
\inlinecode{instance ( IsMember p ps1, IsSubset ps1 ps2) => IsMember p ps2},
would be impossible to use because the compiler has no way of guessing which set \inlinecode{ps1}
it should be checking \inlinecode{p}'s membership in
(and even if it could \emph{guess}, it wouldn't backtrack and try a different guess if its first try didn't work).

To work around such limitations, \MultiChor uses a strategy of \emph{proof witnesses}
like those described by \cite{noonanGDP}.
These are vacuous runtime values with specially crafted types,
such that the existence of a value of the given type guarentees the truth of some logical assertion.
We do not actually use the \inlinecode{gdp}\footnote{
    "Ghosts of Departed Proofs"~\cite{gdp_hackage}
} package; we found that writing our own purpose-specific system had a few advantages.
First, we were able to write everything we needed without hand-waving any foundations as \inlinecode{axiom}s.
Second, pattern matching against the constructors of \inlinecode{Member l ls} suffices to convince GHC that \inlinecode{ls} is not empty,
which is sometimes useful.
Finally, the implicit paradigm of "memberships as indices \& subsets as functions" was qualitatively easier to work with
when we were building the census-polymorphism tools described in Section~\ref{sec:census-poly}.

In \MultiChor, locations are identified by type-level strings, uninhabited types with "kind" \inlinecode{Symbol}.
A values of type \inlinecode{Member p ps} can be used both
as proof that \inlinecode{p} is eligible to take some action (because of their membership in \inlinecode{ps})
and as a term-level identifier for the party \inlinecode{p}.
It's actual form will be that of an index in the type-level list \inlinecode{ps} at which \inlinecode{p} appears.
Subset relations are expressed and used similarly.
A value of type \inlinecode{Subset ps qs} has the underlying form of a function
from \inlinecode{Member p ps} to \inlinecode{Member p qs},
\emph{universally quantified over \inlinecode{p}}.
Because these logical structures can be built from scratch inside Haskell's type system,
all of the machinery we use to do so can safely be exposed to end-users so that they can write their own proofs, as needed, inside choreographies.
In practice however, they will usually use higher-level operators.
For example, the pattern \inlinecode{p @@ nobody}, read as \emph{"\inlinecode{p} and nobody else"},
makes a \inlinecode{Subset '[p] ps} out of a \inlinecode{Member p ps}.

During the job interview with Well Typed, they discussed some alternatives to the proof-witness pattern that can probably work.
I haven't played with it enough to say if it would be \emph{better},
but I should make sure to understand what they're doing well enough to express an opinion about it here.

\section{Census Polymorphism}
\label{sec:census-poly}

TODO: This is copy-pasted directly from the enclaves paper; it must be edited/rewritten for this context.

So far, the example choreographies we have discussed have had fixed numbers of participants.
In all prior CP systems this has been a syntactic constraint:
even systems that allow polymorphism over the identities of participants require the participants' "roles" to be explicitly defined in-context.
This is a serious limitation for writing choreographic software;
modern concurrent systems often use dozens to thousands of participants
and are defined parametrically over their number of participants~\cite{bigConcurrent1, corrigan2017prio, bigConcurrent3, bigConcurrent4, dprio2023}.
We assert that such parametric protocol declarations are a required feature for CP to find mainstream use;
our systems provide it in the form of \emph{census polymorphism}.

By "census polymorphism", we mean that a choreographic expression is polymorphic over its census type-variable,
including not just the specific identities listed but also the quantity.\footnote{
    In principle, one can split hairs between census polymorphism and similar polymorphism over other sets of parties, \eg ownership sets.
    We have not found such distinctions to be useful for describing system capabilities,
    but they can be relevant when talking about the type of a given expression.
}
Naïvely, this is trivial; any \MultiChor expression can easily be written with a type variable as its census
and the relevant parties (whose exact identities can also be polymorphic) can be guaranteed to be present by taking
membership proofs as arguments.
However, this approach has a limitation: Since the number of type variables of a choreography must be fixed
and there is no way to \emph{explicitly list} an arbitrary number of parties,
there may be parties not identified by such arguments.
They'll receive any broadcasts and participate in any active replication that applies to the whole census,
but there's no way to specify them as the senders of messages, nor is there any way to specify that they should receive a message
except by sending it to the whole census.
For this reason, when we speak of "census polymorphism",
we mean \emph{useful} polymorphism that lets an unspecified quantity of parties actively participate in the choreography.
For example one might wish to write a \inlinecode{gather} operation
in which a polymorphic list of participants each send a computed value to a common recipient who aggregates them.
Figure~\ref{fig:census-poly-example} shows an example \MultiChor choreography for a key-value store with a polymorphic list of backup servers.
In Appendix~\ref{sec:mpc} we implement the GMW protocol~\cite{goldreich2019play}, a foundational protocol in multi-party cryptography.
In earlier CP systems it would be necessary to hard-code the number of participants when writing such choreographies.
In this section we show how our libraries overcome the above limitation and represent census-polymorphic choreographies.

        The main action happens in \inlinecode{handleRequest},
        a choreography involving only the servers which is called via \inlinecode{enclave} on line 21.
        \inlinecode{handleRequest}'s census explicitly includes the primary server, but is polymorphic over the list of backup servers.
        The primary server broadcasts the request (line~5--12); the backups will update their state and report their health
        only for a \inlinecode{Put} request.
        On line 7 the backups call the local IO function \inlinecode{handlePut} in \inlinecode{parallel} using their individual state references;
        \inlinecode{oks} is therefore a \inlinecode{Faceted backups '[] Response}.
        (The extra \inlinecode{'[]} denotes that no party yet knows all of the \inlinecode{oks}.)
        \inlinecode{gather} (line 8) communicates all the \inlinecode{oks} to the primary server
        where they're stored as a \inlinecode{Quire backups Response}.
        If all the backups are ok, then the primary server also handles the request (line 10).

\end{figure*}

The first thing that is necessary is a way to loop over a polymorphic list of parties.
The second thing is the ability to express and use divergent data known by un-enumerated parties.
We call such data structures \emph{faceted values}\footnote{
    The word "faceted" is most commonly used in reference to a cut gemstone,
    but analogy to the facets of polyhedral playing dice might be more on-the-nose.
};
they're basically the same as the faceted values introduced in \cite{austin2012},
except their public facet is always "$\bot$" and multiple parties have distinct private facets.
Conceptually, a faceted value is similar to an MLV
(it projects to an owner as a simple value and to a non-owner as a placeholder),
but different owners of a faceted value will have different values for it.
To see the need for faceted values, consider how one would write a census-polymorphic \inlinecode{gather} operation
using only an appropriately-specialized \inlinecode{for}-loop:
Each sender would need to generate its value to send \emph{inside} the loop body,
and the only way for the sent values to be distinct would be by using private local state accessed by \inlinecode{locally}.
This would hardly be satisfying, and the dual case of \inlinecode{scatter} would be even worse:
Any use to which the received values were to be put would also have to fit inside the body of the \inlinecode{for}-loop.
(One couldn't simply append the \inlinecode{scatter}ed values to a list in a typed language
because \inlinecode{Located} values with different owners have different types.)
Our implementations provide these needed features in different ways as discussed in \Cref{sec:census-poly-haskell,sec:census-poly-rust}.

In all three of our implementations, census polymorphism can be resolved statically,
\ie, while one can write choreographies and choreographic functions that are census-polymorphic,
it is always possible in principal to unroll the top-level choreography
(that actually gets compiled)
into a monomorphic form.
(Therefore, we do not bother with a separate proof of the soundness of census polymorphism.)
In \MultiChor, this is denoted by \inlinecode{KnownSymbols} constraints in some type signatures.
We leave any clarity about the prospects of \emph{dynamic} census polymorphism for future work.


\subsection{Census Polymorphism in \MultiChor}
\label{sec:census-poly-haskell}

We leverage the type system of modern Haskell to achieve useful census polymorphism in \MultiChor.
This behavior is implemented as a layer \textit{on top of} \MultiChor's central monad and data-types;
from a theory perspective \MultiChor gets census polymorphism "for free" because it's a Haskell library.
The \MultiChor repository contains over a dozen example choreographies, several of which use census polymorphism.
In Figure~\ref{fig:census-poly-example} we showcase a key-value store choreography that's polymorphic over the number of backup servers.
\Cref{sec:mpc} presents a more involved census-polymorphic example.

Key to \MultiChor's strategy is Haskell's ability to express quantified type variables.
For example, a \inlinecode{Faceted} value is (underneath a little boiler-plate) a function.
Its argument is a \inlinecode{Member} proof that some party is in the list of owners,
and it returns a \inlinecode{Located} value known to the party in question.
Notably, nothing about the type, \inlinecode{Faceted ps cmn x}, indicates who the (type-level!) party indicated by the argument might be.
(The second type parameter, \inlinecode{cmn}, represents parties who know \emph{all} the contained values;
it's frequently \inlinecode{'[]}.)

\inlinecode{Faceted ps cmn x} is actually a special case of a more general type,
\inlinecode{PIndexed ps f}, where \inlinecode{f} can be any \emph{type-level function} from a party to a concrete type.
A \inlinecode{PIndexed} is effectively a type-indexed vector,
except that the type of the value retrieved depends on the index\footnote{
    The case where it does not depend on the index, \ie when \inlinecode{f} is \inlinecode{Const},
    is sufficiently useful in its own right that we package it as the type \inlinecode{Quire}.
    "Quire" is pronounced "choir"; it rhymes with "buyer" and means "a stack of sheets of paper, all cut to the same size".
    Each individual piece of paper is a "leaf".
}.
Because of its unusual \inlinecode{kind}, type classes that one would expect to apply to vectors generally do not apply to \inlinecode{PIndexed}.
What's actually needed for census polymorphism is the ability to \inlinecode{sequence} a \inlinecode{PIndexed} of choreographies.
Since \inlinecode{PIndexed} is not an instance of \inlinecode{Traversable},
we implement the needed function \inlinecode{sequenceP}, which is effectively just a \inlinecode{for}-loop
(in any monad) over type-level lists of parties.
These loops are not unrolled at compile time;
the type class \inlinecode{KnownSymbols} affords to the runtime environment sufficient knowledge of the type-level list.

  \end{mdframed}
\end{figure*}

We could write a satisfactory \inlinecode{scatter} and \inlinecode{gather} directly using \inlinecode{sequenceP},
but we find that by defining the intermediary functions \inlinecode{fanOut} and \inlinecode{fanIn}
we can avoid almost all situations where a programmer might need to use \inlinecode{sequenceP} directly in a choreography.
\inlinecode{fanOut}'s argument is a choreography that results in a \inlinecode{Located} value at the party identified by the loop variable;
it aggregates these results as a \inlinecode{Faceted}.
\inlinecode{fanIn} is almost the same, except that the locations of the resulting values do not vary,
and they are aggregated in a \inlinecode{Quire} located at some list of recipients.
\Cref{fig:census-poly-haskell} shows the type signatures for \inlinecode{sequenceP}, \inlinecode{fanOut}, and \inlinecode{scatter}.
Keen readers may notice that the "\inlinecode{cmn}" parties' views of a \inlinecode{Faceted} are effectively just a \inlinecode{Quire},
and so wonder at the need for \inlinecode{fanIn}.
In fact, \inlinecode{fanIn} \emph{is} less often used than \inlinecode{fanOut},
but it's necessary for expressing choreographic loops that yield values which aren't known to the parties over whom the loop is defined.
For example, the GMW protocol, which we implement using \MultiChor in \Cref{sec:mpc}, cannot be written using only \inlinecode{fanOut}.

Modern Haskell language features, especially type-variable quantification,
enable \MultiChor's implementation of census polymorphism to be entirely type-safe and transparent to users.
This is a flexible system within which users can easily write their own novel and bespoke functions and data structures;
we will show in the following section that such flexibility is not entirely necessary for census polymorphism.
