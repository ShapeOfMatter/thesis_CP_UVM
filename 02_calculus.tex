Do chapters really need their own abstracts?

\section{Introduction}
Plan A is to copy-paste large sections of \emph{"We Know I Know You Know"}, with revisions from the enclaves paper etc as needed.
Iff I make a new formalism, then I'll have to decide how to integrate it here. 

\section{Comparisons with other systems}
\label{sec:formalism-comparisons}
In particular, how does E\&M stack up against S\&M?
This could also just be copy-pasta, or we could expand it with something more like a proof.

A citation might help this compile? \shortcite{shen-alg-eff-cp}
