Bigger things:
- Add a high-level description of the topic and contributions in the intro
  - Even the illustrative example is too complex
  - Need gentler intro - a page or two aimed at a more general audience
  > Section 1.1.3 "Basics of Choreographic Programming" now preceeds the KVS
      example.
- Add a more detailed description of contributions
  - Motivation for why they matter
  - Specific, detailed improvement over previous ways of doing the same thing
  > Section 1.1.2 "Contributions" enumerates the specific contributions and
      how they relate to the prior state of the art. The respective chapters
      contain some additional detail (some new and some unchanged from the
      previously submitted version).
  - Eliminate subjective claims about simplicity, usability, or real-world
      readiness that don't have evidence
  > I've edited or removed language in a few places that I think this is
      refering to; hopefully I haven't missed any particular statements
      you find concerning or exagerated.
- Add more detailed comparison to related areas
  - (e.g. multiparty session types)
  > Section 1.2.1 "History and Adjacent Domains" is expanded, and contains
      paragraphs re: MPST, Multitier programming, and more foundational
      systems.
- Improve the conclusion
  - Split minichor from future work, make minichor a chapter
  > Minichor is now described in Chapter 4 "MiniChor is MultiChor, Just
      Smaller".
  > Usability issues in MultiChor are now in Section 3.5.2 "User challenges
      in MultiChor".
  - Make conclusion/future work a separate chapter
  > "Conclusions" is now Chapter 5, containing Section 5.1 "Suggestions for
      Future Work".

Smaller things:
- Motivate GMW - a real world protocol that includes multiple communication
    patterns (say why you included it as an example)
  > This is at the begining of Section 3.5 "Utility and Usability of
      MultiChor".
- on the GMW example, either fix the citation (if 1-out-of-2 OT is correct)
    or fix the code (if 1-out-of-4 is needed).
  > The relevant Paragraph in Section 3.5.1 "The GMW Protocol in MultiChor"
      cites the source used and explains how the technique works.
- Add info on the proof witness system - need some background or explanation
  > Section 3.3 "Membership Constraints & Proof Witnesses" is expanded.
- Cite ESOP paper on first-person choreographic programming
  > This is grouped with multitier programming in Section 1.2.1.

Format check:
- You are missing one element to your title page- the defense date and
    defense committee information.
  > done
- Please remove the signature page after your title page- these are not used
  > done
- Please ensure that the title of your Citations page matches the font style
    and placement of the rest of your preface page titles
  > done
- On your Citations page, you may only include material that has been
    published, accepted for publication, or submitted for publication.
  > done
- Please also type each author Last name, first initial. middle initial.,
    with a double period (..) for the last author.
  > done
- Please remove the running header from your chapters
  > done

Additionally:
> clarify MiniChor's relation to earlier systems (in Section 4.4).
> fix tilde in code font. (It's still not great.)
> fix urls in bibliography.
