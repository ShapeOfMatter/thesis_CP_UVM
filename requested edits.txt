Bigger things:
- Add a high-level description of the topic and contributions in the intro
  - Even the illustrative example is too complex
  - Need gentler intro - a page or two aimed at a more general audience
- Add a more detailed description of contributions
  - Motivation for why they matter
  - Specific, detailed improvement over previous ways of doing the same thing
  - Eliminate subjective claims about simplicity, usability, or real-world readiness that don't have evidence
- Add more detailed comparison to related areas (e.g. multiparty session types)
- Improve the conclusion
  X Split minichor from future work, make minichor a chapter
  X Make conclusion/future work a separate chapter

Smaller things:
- Motivate GMW - a real world protocol that includes multiple communication patterns (say why you included it as an example)
- on the GMW example, either fix the citation (if 1-out-of-2 OT is correct) or fix the code (if 1-out-of-4 is needed).
X Add info on the proof witness system - need some background or explanation
X Cite ESOP paper on first-person choreographic programming
